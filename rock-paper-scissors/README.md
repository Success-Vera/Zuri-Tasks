This function is a game between the computer and a user.
    The valid options to make a choice from are:
    
    characters_=['R','P','S']

    where:

    "R" for "rock", 
    "P" for "paper", 
    "S" for "scissors"

    If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), we print an error, and ask for their input again.
    If there is a winner, we print the winner, and the program ends. 
    If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game.

    computer=CPU
    human=user
